#Primary Research Question:
#For artists age 30 or older, do female artists play different kinds of music on Austin City Limits than male artists?

#Calculate P(A|B): the probability of each genre, given the artistâ€™s gender.

#Conclusions:
#The music played on Austin City Limits was grouped into four genres, including Country, Jazz, Rock and Singer-Songwriter. 
#We wanted to examine only those artists who were age 30 or older. 
#Rock was the most frequently played genre, performed by  59.8 % of the Austin City Limits artists. 
#Among female artists, however, only correct 32 % of the artists played Rock music. 
#This difference between the marginal and conditional probabilities suggests that gender and genre are not independent.
#This difference was also evident in the bar plots,
#where it was evident that females were more likely to perform in the Singer-Songwriter category than their male counterparts.
