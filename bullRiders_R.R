#Determine which variable has the strongest linear relationship with Earnings12.
#The strongest linear relationship with Earnings12 has CupPoints12: 0.657 with outliar and 0.893 without an outliar
#Conclusions:
#An initial examination of the relationships between Ride Percentage (RidePer) and Earnings, 
#and Cup Points (CupPoints) and Earnings showed that Cup Points had the  stronger relationship to Earnings. 
#Ride Percentage and Earnings showed a correlation value of 0.593 
#while Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of 0.657 .
#Visual examination showed an  outliar in both relationships â€” a rider who has earned over 1 million dollars.
#Removal of this increased the initial relationship: Ride Percentage and Earnings now had a correlation value of 0.804
#and Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of 0.893 .  
#Cup Points still had the higher relationship to Earnings. 
#Visual examination showed a good linear relationship for both Ride Percentage and Cup Points, 
#indicating the correct use of the correlation coefficient.
